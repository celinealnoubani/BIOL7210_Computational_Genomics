# B3: Genotyping, Taxonomic Classification, and Quality Assessment

## 📂 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **genotyping, taxonomic classification, and quality assessment** for preliminarily the smallest and largest samples, and subsequently all 34 assembly files/samples in phase 2. The final results goal is to design a final pipeline with our narrowed down tools from the preliminary results that covers a complete start-to-finish analysis, demonstrating the ability to process real sequencing data into meaningful biological insights.
