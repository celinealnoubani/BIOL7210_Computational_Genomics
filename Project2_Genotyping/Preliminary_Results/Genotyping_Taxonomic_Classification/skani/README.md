# Skani Directory

## Overview
From the previous projects, our sample was identified as 'Neisseria gonorrhoeae'.
We performed taxonomic classification running skani, using the largest and smallest assembly file from the group 1 and the reference genome downloaded from NCBI database.

## File Description  
* `result.tsv` : This file is the tsv output file from skani. This contains ANI score and alignment fraction of query assemblies against reference genome. 
* `preliminary_results_commands.sh` : This script shows how to reproduce the result. You can get result and log file by running this script.
* `skani.log` : This is the log file for running skani.

## System Information
The information for the OS used for these results is listed below.
