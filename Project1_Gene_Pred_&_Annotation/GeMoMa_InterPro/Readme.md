# GeMoMa Gene Prediction & InterPro Annotation Results

This repository contains the results of a two-step gene analysis pipeline executed on the PACE cluster. First, genes are predicted using the GeMoMa pipeline, and then the predicted protein sequences are annotated using InterProScan. This repository includes input data, GeMoMa output files, InterProScan result TSVs, log files, the main commands script, and the overall data file structure.

## System Specifications

- **Cluster Environment**: PACE Cluster  
- **Modules**: Anaconda 3 (2023.03)
- **Quality of Service**: coc-ice
- **Node Type**: AMD CPU  
  - **Processor Model**: AMD EPYC 7513 32-Core Processor  
  - **Allocated Cores**: 16  
- **Memory**: 32 GB per node

## Tools Used

- **GeMoMa**: Version 1.9  
- **InterProScan**: Version 5.73-104.0

## Important Notes

- The provided pipeline scripts assume that the file structure of this repository matches the layout on the PACE cluster. Adjust file paths if files are relocated.
- Performance metrics (runtime and memory usage) for both GeMoMa and InterProScan are recorded in log files.
- For large datasets, consider tuning CPU and memory allocations in the scripts to optimize performance.
- Some results and logs may be compressed (e.g., using gzip) for easier storage and transfer.

## File Structure

- **`data/`**  
  - **`contigs/`**:  
    Contains filtered contig FASTA files for each sample.
  - **`reference/`**:  
    Contains reference genome files used by GeMoMa (genomic FASTA and GFF files).

- **`results/`**  
  - **`gemoma/`**:  
    Contains output folders for each sample from the GeMoMa pipeline. Each folder includes:  
    - `predicted_proteins.fasta`: Predicted protein sequences in FASTA format.  
    - `[sample]_predictions.gff`: GFF annotation file with predicted gene models.  
    - Other intermediate files generated by GeMoMa.
  - **`interpro/`**:  
    Contains InterProScan output TSV files for each sample.

- **`logs/`**  
  Contains log files for each sample documenting runtime and memory usage for both GeMoMa and InterProScan.

- **`final_report/`**  
  Contains a consolidated TSV file (e.g., `final_metrics.tsv`) that summarizes performance metrics and output statistics for both tools.  
  - For GeMoMa, the TSV row includes the sample name, tool ("GeMoMa"), memory usage, runtime, CDS count, and "NA" for annotated proteins.  
  - For InterProScan, the TSV row includes the sample name, tool ("InterProScan"), memory usage, runtime, "NA" for CDS count, and the number of annotated proteins.

- **`run_pipeline.sh/`**  
  Contains the commands used to run the GeMoMa and InterProScan workflows (main pipeline script).

- **`README.md`**  
  This file, which describes the project, system specifications, tools used, and file structure.
